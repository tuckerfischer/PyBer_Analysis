Ride fares were the greatest for urban cities and the lowest for rural cities.

## Summary

Based on the resulting graph from our analysis we determined that:

  1. Focus should be placed on growing the urban market as this is where fares are the highest
  2. Research needs to be done on the rural markets to determine how to increase ride volume 
  3. Data should be collected to determine margin percentage in each market
